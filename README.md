# About "Hytale Bedwars"

In Hytale's early state, nobody has made a dynamic, well structured, and polished
plugin for implementing a minigame into Hytale, and we wanted to stand out with an easy-to-integrate Bedwars plugin (nobody has made a good bedwars ;) ).

### Section I, Install.

When installing the mod .jar for this plugin, you will need to locate your HytaleServer, and put this plugin in the "mods" folder.


### Section II, Build Your Map.

Build to your hearts content!

Keep in mind, you will need to keep tabs of the following:

- Gamemode to account for
- All team spawn locations
- All team bed locations
- All team forge locations
- Location of the queue lobby
- FOUR diamond generator locations
- TWO emerald generator locations

### Section III, Deploy Your Map

do /deploy, and go through the process with all of the above written down.

### Section IV, Grow.

Now your bedwars map is playable! do /activatemap to start the gameplay loop.

### Section V, Tinker.

Server developers are free to edit this plugin to allow for datastores or addition of new gamemodes, etc.

You are not allowed to advertise this as your own plugin if you make changes, give credit where credit is due.
