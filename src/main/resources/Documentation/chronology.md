# Devnotes

This is the note/roadmap to develop the project.

## Start of Game
##### There needs to be a chronological sequence of steps to enter the game.
1. Player joins lobby


2. Player enters into a bedwars queue lobby upon interaction of something


3. Bedwars lobby server will wait for 8 players to start, will start automatically after 30 seconds if there are 3 or more people on.


4. Send players to their random spawns.

5. If a player leaves, automatically eliminate their team.

## During Game

1. Currency items will spawn at the player's base, as well as mid, they are used to buy blocks/items.


2. Set global timers upon game start for the "Diamond" and "Emerald" spawns.


4. UI for buying items/upgrades.


4. Upon player death, they will get a message "You died! Respawning in 5.. seconds"


5. When player's bed destroyed, send notifier. Set a flag, and when they die eliminate them from the server upon respawn.


## Wrap Up Game
1. When a player wins, send a message, play some sounds/music.
2. After 5 seconds, prompt UI to leave or play again.
3. After 30 seconds, send the user back to the lobby.
